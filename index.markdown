Hi! I'm Malik, a student at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) studying [Biophysics](https://lsa.umich.edu/biophysics) and [Mathematical Biology](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates.html). I enjoy learning about new tools (especially computational!) and their relation to solving problems in Chemistry and Medicine. 

A little more about me:
- I'm currently working in the [Sztain Lab](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/sztainlab/home) on the redesign of Nylonase, a Nylon Oligomer Hydrolase. 
- Working the the [Michigan Synthetic Biology Team](https://websites.umich.edu/~umichsynbio/index.html) as a co-lead for Human Practices and on our computational modeling team.
- I've taught Ochem this past year and am hoping to TA for other chemistry/math classes

Hoping to update this page with more info about myself in the future, but in the meantime feel free to check out some of my projects and stuff I've written!

Commited to building towards a better future.
