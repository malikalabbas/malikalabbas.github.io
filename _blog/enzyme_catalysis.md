This is more for my own purpose, i will be recollecting my notes and ideas from multiple papers by notable biophysicists such as Warshel, Baker, and Herschlag. First though, should be the current approach to understanding enzyme catalysis, at least at a text book level, as well as discussion about the michaelis mentin equation, various kinetics, and some stat mech with the mass action law. Stay tuned for more tho.

# From the top, why is Chemistry even important?
